# 🏥 Doctor Management & Booking System

## Overview
This project is a **Doctor & Clinic Booking System** 🩺, allowing users to find doctors, check availability, and book sessions easily. My contribution focused on the **Doctor Module**, handling all doctor-related data and APIs.

## 💼 My Work

- Managed **Doctor profiles** with key info (name, email, specialization, profile photo) 👨‍⚕️👩‍⚕️.
- Added **geolocation** (lat & lng) for each doctor to find the nearest doctor 🌍📍.
- Implemented **availability slots** with future dates & precise time intervals ⏰📅.
- Linked **specialization details** (name + ID + optional image) 🧬.
- Aggregated stats for doctors:
  - `reviews_count` 📝
  - `average_rating` ⭐️
  - `patients_count` 👥
- Data exposed via **API** with **pagination** for smooth frontend consumption 📡.

## 🛠 Technical Notes
- Built with **Laravel**, structured using **API Resources, Form Requests & Service Layer** for clean code.
- All sensitive info like passwords is hidden 🔒.
- Test data generated via **Factories & Seeders** for easy development.

✨ Fully integrated, production-ready Doctor Module, ready to connect with future booking & patient features.
